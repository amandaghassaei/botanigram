### Create "growing" animations of plants from a single photograph

The magic behind these animations is a natural phenomenon called the **golden angle**, which governs the spacing of leaves, petals, and branches on a growing plant.  The golden angle (137.5&deg;) is responsible for the spiral patterns on pinecones, sunflowers, and succulents, and is related to the Fibonacci series and the golden ratio.

Use this app to create your own animations and see how your plants grow.
